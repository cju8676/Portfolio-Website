    <h5>Technologies Used:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>React JS</li>
      <li>Node JS/Express</li>
      <li>PostgreSQL</li>
      <li>AWS S3, EC2, RDS</li>
      <li>GitHub/GitHub Actions</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Description:</h5>
    <p>It was always somewhat difficult to manage and figure out totals at 
        our poker home games. Thus, we created an easy to use webapp that
        allows users to create a game, add players, and add/remove chips
        and much more, all in real time while handling all of the calculations.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Besides this, some added features include: A home dashboard curated towards
        each unique player, a game history page that shows each game a user was involved in,
        a leaderboard, and a charting system to view and compare progress over time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The app is hosted using an AWS S3 bucket that interacts with an Express API running
        on an AWS EC2 instance. The database is a PostgreSQL database hosted on an AWS RDS
        instance. The app is also connected to a GitHub repository that uses GitHub Actions
        to automatically deploy the app to the S3/EC2 instances respectively when a push is made to the master
        branch.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h4>Pages</h4>

    <h5>Dashboard</h5>
    <p>As shown above, the dashboard is a personalized page for each user that
        shows their current revenue total, rankings, charts, and a list of their
        previous games. From here, users can see everything they need to know about
        how they have been playing. 
    </p>

    <h5>Games Page</h5>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="images/poker/games.png" alt="Games Page">
    </div>
    <p>The games page gives a nice chronological view of all games the user has been
        involved in, along with the ability to view game details or start a brand new game.
    </p>

    <h5>Players</h5>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="images/poker/players.png" alt="Players Page">
    </div>
    <p>The players page displays a leaderboard of home game players over time.</p>
    <br>

    <h5>Stats</h5>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="images/poker/stats.png" alt="Players Page">
    </div>
    <p>Finally, the stats page gives us a multi-select graph to compare user performance against.
        Whether we want a quick comparison, or an in-depth model of players head-to-head over time,
        this graph gives us that flexibility.
