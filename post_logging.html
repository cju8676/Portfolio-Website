    <h5>Technologies Used:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>MongoDB</li>
      <li>React JS</li>
      <li>Express JS</li>
      <li>Node JS</li>
      <li>Microsoft Azure</li>

    </ul>
    <h5>Description:</h5>
    <p>This application was built using the MERN technology stack, for the
    intention of giving the DirecNet team a seamless dashboard to carry out
    field testing, standups, reproducible field tests, and more. Hosted through
    Microsoft Azure and their Cosmos DB, App Service, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Application features include: Jira/BitBucket Server dynamic updates,
    tracking code commits/status, a full weather page, making test suites
    for future field tests, mapping location of said tests, and a fully
    integrated calendar and status widgets to integrate into team standups
    and meetings.</p>
    <br>
    <h6>* Note: Confidential HII information/data has been blurred.</h6>
    <h5>Dashboard</h5>
    <div class="two-img">
      <img
        src="images/dnet/loggingdash.png"
        alt="Logging Dash"
        style="max-width: 70vh; height: auto;">
      <img
        src="images/dnet/loggingdash2.png"
        alt="Logging Dash Bottom"
        style="max-width: 70vh; height: auto;">
    </div>
    <p>The Dashboard features Atlassian quick links, Latest Software build widgets,
    recent field tests, overviews of team status and progress, field testing conditions,
    and important calendar events.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Users can interact with each widget, adding, editing, or removing data
    entries which may correspond to what the team is working on, what they want to view,
    or redirect them to the corresponding page.</p>

    <h5>Tests Page</h5>
    <img src="images/dnet/testpagetable.png" alt="Testing Page Home">
    <p>Users view the previous field tests in chronological order in a compact
    table view. Users can click on a table entry to view a more in depth view,
    order the table by a different category, or press the add button at the top
    to create a new test suite.</p>
    <img src="images/dnet/newtest.png" alt="Create New Test Suite">
    <p>Users will go through and create a new test entry by clicking and
    editing each text entry. A default entry is populated with text entries the
    users can go through and edit/save at any time they need.</p>
    <h5>Maps Page</h5>
    <img src="images/dnet/newmaps.png" alt="Create New Maps">
    <p>Similar to creating a new test suite, there is the ability to create a
    fixed maps scenario of the certain field test you are trying to perform
    over and over again. A maps Pane is pre populated where node actions (such as
    moving, linking, disconnecting, etc.), coordinates, colors, shapes, zoom,
    and more are customizable and can be edited/saved at any time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>These test scenes are then linked to a test suite when it is performed
    later on. Therefore, when a test is completed, we have complete control over
    replicating the scenario, node arrangement, actions, and more. Thus, This
    eliminates a multitude of variables that could cause a field test to be
    scrapped.</p>
    <h5>Calendar</h5>
    <img src="images/dnet/calendarpage.png" alt="Calendar Page">
    <p>The Calendar mini app is a full size version of the calendar widget on
    the Dashboard. Similar to Google Calendar, users can input, edit, and remove
    events on the calendar to signify important dates the team should keep note
    of.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This component has several abilities which come from the Syncfusion React
    library and allow the user to switch views, days they are viewing, drag and
    drop events, and more.</p>

    <h5>Weather</h5>
    <img src="images/dnet/weatherpage.png" alt="Weather Page">
    <p>Lastly, the weather mini app is another full size version of a Dashboard
    widget. Data is parsed from an OpenWeatherAPI call to generate weather data
    in a dashboard format the user can view on the front end. In the settings,
    users have the ability to change the location that gets queried.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Features on this page include a graph display of the hourly breakdown
    (that can be switched to an hourly precipitation chance breakdown), a 7-day
    forecast on the right hand side, chance of rain, wind speed, humidity, and
    UV index. This page also incorporates Syncfusion React library components
    that have customizable and reusable properties.</p>
